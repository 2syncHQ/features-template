# Feature Requests Board template

This repo requires [this Notion Template](http://go.tonoid.com/feature-requests-board-notion-template) to work properly.

## One-click deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](http://go.tonoid.com/feature-requests-board-deploy-vercel)

## Environment variables

### NOTION_API_TOKEN

Create an internal integration on [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).
Add the newly created integration to the database [Ideas](https://shots.tonoid.com/00gPccPy)
Paste the Internal Integration Secret as environement variable (this should start with `secret_...`)

### NOTION_IDEAS_DATABASE_ID

This is the database id of the notion database [Ideas](https://shots.tonoid.com/00gPccPy), this should look like `03f73fa720c947bbaf9652661594debc` (don't use this example ofc, it's located on the page link)

### NOTION_SUBMIT_IDEA_PAGE_ID

This is the page id of the page [Submit an idea](https://shots.tonoid.com/Kxvf2Gv4), this should look like `03f73fa720c947bbaf9652661594debc` located just after `Submit-an-idea-` (don't use this example ofc, it's located on the page link)

### NOTION_BOARD_PAGE_ID

This is the page id of the page [Board](https://shots.tonoid.com/21c1qn36), this should look like `03f73fa720c947bbaf9652661594debc` located just after `Board-` (don't use this example ofc, it's located on the page link)

### FEATURE_BOARD_URL_ROOT

This is the root URL of the feature board that you have deployed on Vercel.
Since you do not know that domain before the first deploy, just use this as placeholder: `https://feature-requests.vercel.app/`
And then you'll be able to change it later.

### FORM_FEATURE_URL_ROOT

You can use the same value as FEATURE_BOARD_URL_ROOT
On the deployed site, we have an endpoint that detects the parent page of the form, to get the feature slug. This can either be hosted on the feature requests board, or on your own API (to be able to detect the cookie, and get logged in user details).
